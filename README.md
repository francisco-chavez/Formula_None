Formula_None
============

An XNA 4.0 based racing game with a WPF/MVVM based Race Track Editor.

Notes:

In order to use the Race Track Editor project, you might have to go into the "Source Code/formulaNoneSLN/Libraries/Extended WPF Toolkit/" folder and unblock the Xceed.Wpf.Toolkit.dll; in the off chance that you build the project before doing this, you might have to do the same to the dll file in your bin folder.
